## Hello! Welcome to my profile :smiley:
### A bit about me!
:books:Studying at Aicore

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Umair a 1st class chemistry graduate from King's college london.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in data engineering and data science
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently doing an Ai and data course. So far in the course I have successfully completed two projects (:dancer:) and learnt to use: python, SQL, pandas, AWS, docker, Prometheus, Github/git, numpy and CI/CD. At the moment I am writing a code for a hangman game and I am in the process of deciding my specialisation field.
